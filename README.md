>Spartan Event (SE) is a tool for event organizers to communicate with
>UNCG students. Its design allows for seamless use and accessible use. 
>It is a web application that can be accessed through a web browser.
>Currently it is difficult for clubs and student groups to inform people
>of planned events and this app is going to fix that. The app will allow
>organizers to create, delete, and edit events, as well as view comments
>and RSVPs left by users. Admins will keep converse civil by having the
>ability to delete comments and users. This tool will greatly improve
>student life here at UNCG and it will allow for a more fulfilling 
>college experience.
